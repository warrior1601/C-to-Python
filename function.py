# Here I define a function for my program
# Notice the function has no squiggle brackets like the main function does
def myFirstFunctionCall():
    print("My First Function Call")


# now I am going to call my function

myFirstFunctionCall()

# notice python doesnt have a main function
# It can be quicker to type up many things in pythin than c++
